<h1>About Eduardo Contreras</h1>

<h3>Career path</h3>
<p>To be honest, I’m not entirely sure why I’m drawn to data science. Maybe it’s just that the words “data” and “science” sound cool together. I’m still figuring out if it’s the right fit for me.</p>
<p>Game development interests me because it combines programming with storytelling. I like the idea that games can tell unique stories, not just the usual hero vs. villain plots, but something more original and personal.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve started getting into full stack web development. I’m currently taking a Udemy course and enjoying it so far. With that said, I’m still unsure about the job demand and long-term growth in that area.</p>
<p>As for AI, I wouldn’t say it’s a passion yet. However, I’m keeping an eye on it because it seems to offer a lot of future opportunities.</p>
